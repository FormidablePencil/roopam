Nuvodia provides Radiology PACS hosting and healthcare technology services to physicians, hospitals, clinics and laboratories across the United States and manages millions of medical imaging exams annually. In 2017, Gestalt spun out as an individual entity and continued to build upon our Image Management System that was developed specifically for Pathology labs.  In 2018, Gestalt acquired Peak Medical to expand its digital pathology integration services, IT support and staff augmentation and legacy LIS support division.",

The PathFlow platform provides a full Image Management System, robust case routing, a Universal viewer, integrated AI and Image Analysis algorithms and reporting.  The Pathologist's Cockpit provides a single, streamlined, fully interoperable workflow for the pathologist to be able to interpret and sign out their case.",
