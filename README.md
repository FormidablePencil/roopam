# Gestalt site

Better and improved version of Gestalt website.

All the data is static but if I had access to the APIs then I would've done it with them.

App is built with React as a SPA but I would have made it as a PWA if it wasn't just of a replica of the original site.

I built it in a day. How did I build it so fast you may ask? I use Vim duh and I'm good at what I do ofcourse.
