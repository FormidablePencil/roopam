# Getting Started with Create React App

Better and improved version of Gestalt website.

App is built with React as a single-page-application but in the real world I would have used Next.js and not have a SPA for it's not good for SEO.

Technologies utilized
Sass
React
(store management)

All the data is static but if I had access to the APIs then I would've done it with those.

How did I build it so fast (in a day), because I use Vim... and I'm good at what I do ofcourse
